1. HelloWorld
1.1 Create Intellij Idea project
object - singleton object, class with single instance

object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("Hello, world!")
  }
}

The declaration above thus declares both a class called HelloWorld and an instance of that class, also called HelloWorld. 
This instance is created on demand, the first time it is used.
This is because static members (methods or fields) do not exist in Scala.

The astute reader might have noticed that the main method is not declared as static here. This is because static members (methods or fields) do not exist in Scala.
Rather than defining static members, the Scala programmer declares these members in singleton objects.

1.2. Run example in Intellij Idea and cmd line

Compile:
scalac HelloWorld.scala

Run: 
scala -classpath . HelloWorld

3. Interaction with Java - FrenchDate

3.1 import selected classes from package
import java.util.{Date, Locale}

3.2 import as static members (LONG, getDateInstance)
import java.text.DateFormat._

scala expression less verbose
println(df format now)
println(df.format(now))
